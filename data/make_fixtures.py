# VS-200 Service Manual: Troubleshooting

## Pump runs but delivers low flow
Check the suction strainer first; a blocked strainer is the cause in most field visits. Then check the impeller for wear. If the flow is still below 80 percent of the rated 42 cubic metres per hour, measure the suction lift; above 6 metres the VS-200 will cavitate.

## Water leaking at the shaft
A leak at the shaft almost always means the mechanical seal has failed. Replace the seal kit (part VS2-SK-11). Do not tighten the gland, the VS-200 has no packing gland. Running the pump dry for more than 30 seconds damages the seal faces.

## Grinding or rattling noise
A grinding noise points to bearing wear or cavitation. Check the bearing temperature: above 80 degrees Celsius, replace both bearings (part VS2-BR-04). A rattling noise like gravel is cavitation; reduce the suction lift or open the suction valve fully.

## Motor trips on overload
Check the supply voltage. The VS-200 motor needs 415 V three phase, plus or minus 10 percent. A single phasing fault trips the overload within seconds.

Between 12 August and 20 September, 9 VS-200 units failed at the shaft seal within 30 days of installation, 6 of them at Shree Agro, Ahmednagar.

## Root cause
A batch of seal kits from our supplier SealTech (lot ST-0826) had carbon faces that were 0.3 mm thinner than the drawing. Combined with dry running during commissioning, the faces cracked.

## Fix
All units with lot ST-0826 get a new seal kit from lot ST-0926, which passed inspection. Commissioning checklist now requires priming the pump before first start. The Shree Agro replacements are scheduled for 28 October.
